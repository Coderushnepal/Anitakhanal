String manipulation

Question 1
Write a function that returns the string "something" joined with a space " " and the given argument a. Examples:

// ("is better than nothing") ➞ "something is better than nothing"

// giveMeSomething("Bob Jane") ➞ "something Bob Jane"
giveMeSomething
// giveMeSomething("something") ➞ "something something"

Question 2

Create a function that takes a word and returns the new word without including the first character.

Examples

newWord("apple") ➞ "pple"

newWord("cherry") ➞ "herry"

newWord("plum") ➞ "lum"
